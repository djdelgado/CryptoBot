## There are two commands built into the bot:

#### "price of (crypto_ticker)"

![example1](screenshots/example1.png)
- This command shows the information displayed above, very easy way to show a group how a certain token is doing
- Use this to brag about how well you call about the currency was or be sadeded about the turn of the coin for the day

### "dump them out"
![example2](screenchots/example2.png)
- This command comes with a few tokens that it will display the value for, however, over time it will display the top 10 tokens that the group is constently asking the price on.
- This is extremely helpful to get a quick idea about how the groups different tokens are doing that day.
